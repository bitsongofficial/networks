# v0.21.2
This guide provides instructions for safely rolling back to v0.20.5 during an upgrade handler for Cosmossdk nodes, ensuring proper handling of the app hash and state.

## Important Notes:
- If your node has already finalized the upgrade block, you **will not** be able to rollback to the upgraded height.
- If you node paniced on the upgrade handler with `panic: validator not found`, your node **will** be able to rollback & complete the upgrade handler as expected with `v0.21.2`. 


## A. STEPS FOR NODES THAT ALREADY HAVE FINALIZED BLOCK `20960377`
This option is for validators & nodes that have gotten past the upgrade handler and finalized the upgrade block. 

### 0. Stop your node
```sh 
pkill -f bitsongd
# pkill -f cosmovisor
```

### 1. Backup your private validator state 
```sh
cp ~/.bitsong/data/priv_validator_state.json ~/priv_validator_state.json.copy
```

### 2. Wait for consensus to resume 


###  3. Sync from snapshot 
A public snapshot will be available to sync. Ensure you replace back your private validator state file

## B. STEPS FOR NODES REQIRING ROLLBACK 

### 0. Stop Node 
```sh 
pkill -f bitsongd
# pkill -f cosmovisor
```

### 1. Revert go-bitsong to version `v0.20.5`
```sh
bitsongd version 
## should be v0.21.1
git checkout v0.20.5
make install
```

###  1.b make home directory backup (optional)
```sh  
cp -r ~/.bitsong ~/.bitsong.backup
```

### 2. Rollback 
```sh  
bitsongd rollback
#  Rolled back state to height 20960376 and hash 4F9B49DE29FDB1F8F6EA7FEAF218FD1197268BDED2B583765B3DB9EBB689E453
```

### 3. upgrade to latest version `v0.21.2`
```sh
bitsongd version 
## should be v0.20.5
git checkout v0.21.2
make install

```

### 4. restart node
```sh  
bitsongd start
```

### 4.a remove backup (optional)

```sh 
cp -r ~/.bitsong ~/.bitsong.backup
```
