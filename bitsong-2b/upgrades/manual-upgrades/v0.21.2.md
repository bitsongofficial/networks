# v0.21.2
This guide provides instructions for safely rolling back to v0.20.5 during an upgrade handler for Cosmossdk nodes, ensuring proper handling of the app hash and state.


## Important Notes:
- Only perform a rollback if your node panics during the upgrade handler.
-  Do not rollback if your node did not panic.
- Rollback may result in double signature infractions if not handled correctly.

```sh
bitsongd version 
## should be v0.21.1
# in go-bitsong, rollback to v0.20.5
git checkout v0.20.5
make install
```

## 2. rollback  
**NOTE:rollback is required if your node has already attempted to get through the upgrade handler, but has paniced**
```sh
bitsongd rollback  
```

## 3. install `v0.21.2`
```sh 
git checkout v0.21.2
