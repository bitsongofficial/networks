# Coordinated Upgrade: v0.20.5

## Reasoning

Inside the distribution keeper store were two delegations containing 0 shares to their validator. This is an acceptale scenario for the x/crisis module to stop the chain from producing blocks if this invariant type was submitted as evidence. 

To prevent the possibility of a chain halt prior to the upgrade v021 proposed from this crisis invariant, a patch to the cosmos-sdk version used ommitted this specific invariant from being registered.
