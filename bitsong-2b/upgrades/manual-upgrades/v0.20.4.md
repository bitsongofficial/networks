# Coordinated Upgrade: v0.20.4

## Reasoning

After the coordinated upgrade to v0.20, nodes experienced a panic during the upgradeHandler logic. This prevented the upgrade from being applied, and stopped consensus at the upgrade height. 
The panic occured as there were delegations with 0 shares and tokens present in the state, resulting in an arethmetic error when querying rewards for these specific delegations. 
A patch was applied by removing the query in the upgrade handler, however delegations impacted by the original v018 upgrade were still present. 

Due to delegators  still unable to unbond or redelegate,  this patch  includes a fork of the cosmos-sdk that sets the voting power calculated from the staking keeper
(which is accurate, since its calculated from delegation tokens), to be used in the distribution keeper (which does not produce an accurate voting power value, due to missing slashing events in store)
